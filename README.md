# SmarterCrockPot
Is a mod for Don't Starve
It alters to Crock Pot to show the user what he's going to cook, 
without cooking it, saving him the time and trouble from unfortunate mistakes. 
It allowes to see upfront even the expected spoilage. 
When multiple recipes are available, the cooking product is chosen at random- now you can see every option before gambling. 
When more than one option exists ( for example 2 monstermeat+2 eggs) - See the odds of every outcome.
